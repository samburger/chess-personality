# Chess Personality Matching System Specification

## Overview
A system that analyzes a user's chess game history (PGN files) and determines their similarity to famous historical chess players using chess stylometry techniques based on the paper "Detecting Individual Decision-Making Style: Exploring Behavioral Stylometry in Chess".

## MVP Features

### Input
- **Format**: PGN file upload
- **Minimum games**: Based on stylometry approach (likely ~50-100 games for meaningful analysis)
- **Time controls**: Any time control accepted
- **Game quality**: No filtering required

### Processing Pipeline

1. **PGN Parsing**
   - Use existing Python chess libraries (e.g., python-chess)
   - Extract moves and board positions from each game
   - No opponent consideration in MVP

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Convert board positions to 34-channel 8x8 representations
   - Use residual CNN blocks for move-level features (320-dimensional vectors)
   - Aggregate moves to game-level using transformer encoder (512-dimensional embeddings)
   - Create player representation by averaging game vectors

3. **Similarity Comparison**
   - Compare user's embedding against pre-computed embeddings of historical players
   - Use cosine similarity for comparison
   - Return most similar historical player

### Historical Players Database
- **Size**: 10-20 most famous grandmasters
- **Players to include** (suggested list):
  - Garry Kasparov
  - Bobby Fischer
  - Magnus Carlsen
  - Anatoly Karpov
  - Mikhail Tal
  - José Raúl Capablanca
  - Alexander Alekhine
  - Emanuel Lasker
  - Mikhail Botvinnik
  - Paul Morphy
  - Tigran Petrosian
  - Boris Spassky
  - Viktor Korchnoi
  - Bent Larsen
  - David Bronstein

### Output
- **User-facing**: Single most similar historical player displayed
- **Backend**: Full similarity scores and detailed analysis available for future features

### Data Storage
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Schema**:
  - User uploads table (id, timestamp, pgn_hash)
  - Processed games table (upload_id, game_index, embedding)
  - Historical players table (player_name, embedding, metadata)
  - Results table (upload_id, player_similarities)

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Language**: Python
- **Chess library**: python-chess
- **ML framework**: PyTorch or TensorFlow
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Initial development**: Jupyter notebook for prototyping

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS (or simple framework like Alpine.js)
- **Features**:
  - PGN file upload interface
  - Loading indicator during processing
  - Result display with historical player information

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Jupyter Notebook)
1. PGN parsing and feature extraction
2. Simple embedding model (may start with basic features before full stylometry)
3. Similarity calculation against small set of historical players
4. Validate approach with test data

### Phase 2: Core System
1. Implement full stylometry model architecture
2. Pre-compute embeddings for historical players
3. Build processing pipeline
4. Create SQLite database schema

### Phase 3: Web Interface
1. File upload functionality
2. Basic UI for results display
3. Connect frontend to backend processing

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Online platform integration (lichess.com, chess.com APIs)
- Multiple player comparison (top 3-5 similar players)
- Detailed style analysis breakdown
- Specific game phase analysis (opening, middlegame, endgame)
- Time period filtering
- Style evolution tracking

## Technical Considerations
- Processing time: Aim for < 30 seconds for 100 games
- Embedding model size: Keep under 100MB for web deployment
- Privacy: No long-term storage of user games unless explicitly permitted
- Scalability: Design for potential expansion to more historical players

## Success Metrics
- Accuracy: Consistent player identification in test sets
- User experience: Clear, interpretable results
- Performance: Fast processing of typical game sets
- Reliability: Robust handling of various PGN formats
